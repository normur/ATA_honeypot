# ATA_honeypot

This is a honeypot project for CMU Course 95-889 final project.  
This honeypot analysis uses the honeypot configuration from https://github.com/mattymcfatty/HoneyPi
  
This configuration alerts on: 
 1. Port Scanning Activities
 2. FTP Connection Attempts
 3. Telnet Connection Attempts
 4. VNC Connection Attempts
 
 
Outside of the InfoSec community, there is a lack of awareness, knowledge and concern for cyber threats. The lay person view of security presumes security through obscurity. 
A common thought about security is:

“Who would want to attack me?!” 
This presentation seeks to provide some context to that question.
